# Cybersecurity labs & projects

Welcome to my collection of cybersecurity-related labs, exercises, and practical projects. This repository serves as a portfolio to showcase my experience gained through academic coursework and self-driven learning.

  ## About me:

My name is Monika and I'm a postgraduate student in Cybersecurity at AGH University of Science and Technology. I'm strongly interested in this broad field, so I'm trying to gain as much experience as I can. Currently I'm training for my first professional cert (CompTIA Security+).

  ## Purpose:

This repository documents my learning journey and practical skills development in cybersecurity. It's intended for:
- Employers looking to assess my technical capabilities
- Peers or students who want to learn from real examples
- My personal progress tracking and reflection

Feel free to copy and use any of the content I will post here.
